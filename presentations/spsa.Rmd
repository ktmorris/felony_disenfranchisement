## Outline

>* Introducing space into the conversation

>* Redefining "lost voters"

>* Identifying neighborhoods with lost voters

>* Testing turnout effects

## Introducing Space

>* Most of the existing literature on felony disenfranchisement and indirect turnout effects looks for effects at the state level [@Miles2004; @Bowers2009; @King2016]

>* But we *know* that incarceration patterns aren't uniformly distributed throughout a given state [see, for instance, @Gelman2007]

>* Turnout effects are likely to be socially mediated - and therefore show up in the neighborhoods where disenfranchised individuals live [e.g. @Foladare1968; @Huckfeldt1979; @Cho2006]


## Redefining Lost Voters

>* Much of the existing literature cannot identify individuals who *would have voted* if not for their disenfranchisement [@Burch2013]

>* This undermines our ability to distinguish the causal effects of incarceration / probation from the effects of disenfranchisement

>* This is especially likely given the low turnout propensity among the formerly disenfranchised [e.g. @Meredith2015; @Gerber2017; @White2019]

## This Project Addresses Both Problems

>* Administrative data from the NYS DOC allows us to conduct individual-level analysis

>* Purge records in the NYS voter file allow us to construct vote histories for disenfranchised individuals

>* Lost voters are all formally disenfranchised individuals who have voted in the past 10 years

## Identifying Neighborhoods with Lost Voters

```{r ttt, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../temp/lost_voters_map.png")
```

## Methodology

* A genetic match algorithm [@Sekhon2011] is used to match treated census block groups to untreated ones.

* Each block group is matched to 30 untreated block groups; matches are done with replacement.

## Matching Results

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="49%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../temp/perc_white_spsa.png", "../temp/perc_black_spsa.png"))
```

## Matching Results

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="49%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../temp/perc_latino_spsa.png", "../temp/income_spsa.png"))
```

## Testing Turnout Effects

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="85%", out.height="85%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../temp/coef_plot1.png"))
```
## Testing Turnout Effects

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="85%", out.height="85%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../temp/coef_plot2.png"))
```

## Testing Turnout Effects

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="85%", out.height="85%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../temp/coef_plot3b.png"))
```

## Testing Turnout Effects

```{r post-est, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../output/dep_map.png"))
```

## Conclusions

>* The indirect turnout effects identified in past research appear to be geographically concentrated where the lost voters live.

>* @Hajnal2009 and others have demonstrated that turnout differentials can have real political implications, especially in low-turnout contests.

>* Felony disenfranchisement undermines Black political representation at the local level.
